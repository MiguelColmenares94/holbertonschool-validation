# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment


## Workflow


1. Clone the repository,
2. Use ubuntu-22.04 as the virtual machine.
3. Position yourself in the correct directory and execute the command make help to validate that the Makefile is present and implements the help target.
4. Each time there is new code pushed on your repository
5. And once per day (whatever time you want)
